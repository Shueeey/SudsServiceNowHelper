# SudsServiceNowHelper
Due to high flux in tickets and issues during Orientation Week, this tool has been developed to help our team spend less time on tickets and more time helping the customer out
Tickets are important though so a robust system was created in place for proper logging of them

v1.0 Beta Release Notes:
 - Sorted out refund issue
 - Still needs a more elegant approach to logging into systems but works for now
 - Yet to implement MFA reset auto Ticket logging
