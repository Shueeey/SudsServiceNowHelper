# SudsServiceNowHelper
Due to high flux in tickets and issues during Orientation Week, this tool has been developed to help our team spend less time on tickets and more time helping the customer out
Tickets are important though so a robust system was created in place for proper logging of them.

v1.0 Beta Release Notes:
 - Sorted out refund issue - Uses Selenium to open and automate tasks and then Javascript to webscrape and put said information on a floating window to streamline refund process. Now multiple windows don't manually have to be opened to verify a refund, now all the information is present when the ticket is opened
 - Still needs a more elegant approach to logging into systems but works for now
 - Yet to implement MFA reset auto Ticket logging
